### Claims, Claim Allowance §101(5)

Claims are what creditors have against the debtor and what the debtor does not want. Bankruptcy law is organized to get the debtor the most relief where possible. A claim includes , judgement reduced or not, any right to payment, “liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or unsecured.”§11 USC 101(5).

A claim must be allowed to participate and get a distribution from a bankruptcy case. First, we have to file a proof of claim,

Timing and Necessity Rule 3002

Allowed claim §502(a)

Estimation 502(c)

*Claimant bear the burden of showing allowance of claim, when objected to reasonably, claimant must prove its entitlement to the claim

### Automatic Stay

The automatic stay protects property of the estate (and others) from creditors after filing and before the bankruptcy case is over. The automatic stay includes adequate protection of third party rights, or _____. Once property is part of the bankruptcy estate, it is protected against the advance of creditors. Creditors can’t

&gt; 1. create a lien §362(a)
 &gt;2. Bring/continue a lawsuit on a pre-petition claim (362(a)(1))
 &gt;3. Attempt to repossess property from the estate (362(a)(3))
 &gt;4. Enforce pre-petition judgements (362(a)(2))
 &gt;5. Setoff debts (362(a)(7))

Willful violation of a stay
: damages, attorney fees, and punitive damages for debtor (362(k)(1))

#### Exceptions: Actions not stayed

&gt;1. Pre-petition domestic support obligation (362(b)(2)(b))
	In this situation, creditor can attack non-estate $$ (not stayed)
	Can also file estate claim at same time (but can only be paid on one—no double tapping)
2. Criminal actions (362(b)(1))
3. Government audits and tax liabilities (362(b)(9))
4. Other actions under Section 362(b)
5. Fines 362(b)(2)(a)(iii)

Automatic Stay Lifted

one of 4 ways—362(c)(1), 362(c)(2)(a), 362(c)(2)(b), and 362(c)(2)(c)

  362(c)(3)+362(c)(4)—prevent serial filers from filing repeatedly just to reap the benefit of an automatic stay

•  362(c)(3)—gives only a 30 day stay (1 previous filing within the last year)

•  362(c)(4)—gives no automatic stay (2 or more previous filings within the last year)

•  **NOTE**Exempts filers that failed means test under Chapter 7 and refiled in Chapter 13

### Exemptions §522

Only applies to individual debtors, not businesses

Option 1: 522(b)(2) Federal exemptions

Option 2: 522(b)(3) State opt out of federal exemptions

•  Residency requirement—domicile in one place for **730 days** preceeding date of filing

if the debtor’s domicile has not been located in a single State for such 730-day period, the place in which the debtor’s domicile was located for 180 days immediately preceding the 730-day period or for a longer portion of such 180-day period than in any other place; 522(b)(3)(a)

Does the debtor have residency for the entire two years pre-petition?

If 2 residences, look back 6 months **before** the 2 yr period, the **longer portion wins**

Federal exemptions §522(d) include:

$23,675 in equity in your home;

$3,775 in equity in your car;

$600 per item in any household goods up to

a total of $12,625;

$2,375 in things you need for your job (tools,

books, etc.);

$1,250 in any property, plus part of the

unused exemption in your home, up to

$11,850;

Your right to receive certain benefits such as

social security, unemployment

compensation, veteran’s benefits, public

assistance, and pensions—regardless of the

amount

Spouses can “stack” exemptions

# Homestead exemption

protects resident’s primary home from creditors and increases in property taxes (every state has a different version of this)

Capped by 522(p)(1) to *$160,375* of “interest acquired by debtor” during 1,215-day period (essentially 3 years, 4 months) prior to filing of petition

•  This is only “active appreciation” of building equity during this period

o  Down payment, mortgage payments, improvements

•  “inactive appreciation” portion is not capped and gets added to the active appreciation part (to exceed the cap)

Includes

Down payment

Payments made on mortgage

Improvements

Value – lien (mortgage) = equity

# 522(f) exemptions

When liens impair the debtor’s exemptions, the liens may be avoided to the extent of the impairment (this amount is washed back into the bankruptcy pot as an unsecured amount)

**Impairment**

**Limitation**

**Discharge**

A discharge allows the debtors to get financial relief, limiting his creditors ability to collect on pre-petition debt.

Surrender Property §521

Not required to be accepted

# Discharge

Section 524(a) bars any attempt to collect a prepetition debt “as a personal liability of the debtor.” Like section 362(a), section 524(a) operates as an injunction, the violation of which can be sanctioned under the court’s contempt power  
Permanently continues the stay of discharged debts

Limitations:

Who and When

Doesn’t eliminate debts, relieves from personal liability

Not all debts dischargeable

Only debts arising **prior** to filing case are discharged (chp 7)

Can Drew's discharge be denied in its entirety for his failure to inform the trustee of his transfer of his Bahamas property upon being asked of transfers within the applicable time period?

One of the grounds for a complete denial of discharge in a Chapter 7 (under 727a) is when the debtor knowingly and fraudulently makes a false oath or account.  Based on the attorney's account of the property transfer, it is entirely possible that Drew thought this property transfer occurred outside of the 2 year reachback period given that most of the process (the bureucracy that the attorney complained about) did indeed occur outside of the 2 year reachback period.  The average person (non-lawyers and non-property agents) may not understand the 548(d)(1) definition of a transfer.  Unless it can be established that Drew both KNOWINGLY and FRAUDULENTLY made this false account, the court cannot use it as a basis to completely deny Drew's discharge (and the facts of the case do not indicate that Drew knowingly and fraudulently did this).

Should Vladimir's request for a complete denial of discharge be granted?

A Chapter 7 case may be completely denied a discharge if one of the reasons listed under 727(a) is met.  Here, Vladimir is alleging fraud and bad behavior as grounds for this complete denial of discharge which would fall under 727(a)(4).  The only potentially fraudulent act in this fact pattern is Drew's false account regarding the transfer of his Bahama's property (as previously discussed).  As previously discussed, it will be difficult to establish that Drew acted both knowingly and fraudulently (see previous analysis), so this is unlikely to succeed.

**Non-Dischargeable Debts §523**

&lt;![if !supportLists]&gt;(1) &lt;![endif]&gt;Accrual of claims—determination as to when a bankruptcy claim occurred

Tests for Accrual (earliest to latest)

&lt;![if !supportLists]&gt;(1) &lt;![endif]&gt;**Conduct test (Grady)-**claims arise when the acts giving rise to the liability were performed (not when harm caused by those acts manifested)

When the defective manufacture was

(2) **Pre-petition relationship test (Piper)—**claim arises from pre-petition conduct where there is also some pre-petition relationship (most popularly used test), when person buys

(3) **Jensen test**—places the accrural date somewhere after where it would be in Piper (but before Frenville)

“fair contemplation” (here means that know of exposure and should know of danger), hard test to determine

“claim” under both Grady and Piper tests occurs pre-petition (so no need to say which test the court was adopting/applying)  this applies to the case here

(4) **Frenville test**, overruled by majority of circuits

*Can’t retaliate against debtor, Section 525

525(a) gov’t units (1) licenses/permits and (2) employment

525(b) private employers: employment, but NOT hiring

525(c) student loans (gotta prove undue hardship)

Does Cara's claim against Drew exist within the bankruptcy case?

Although I will walk through an analysis of claim acrual just in case, I do not believe it matters since Clara was not listed as a creditor on the bankruptcy schedules that were filed and therefore any debt Drew may have to her will not be discharged anyways as a result of the exception to discharge under 523(a)(3) exempting any claim not listed on the bankruptcy schedules from discharge.  &lt;continuing on just in case&gt;

Whether or not Cara's claim will be in the bankruptcy case depends on when the claim accrued (a determination of when the claim occurred).  In the post-Frenville Era (since every jurisdiction has overturned the Frenville test), there are 3 tests the courts use for accrual determination; the Grady test, Jensen Test, and Piper Test.  The Grady Test (conduct test) establishes the claim as accrued when the act that led to the liability was performed.  The Piper Test (relationship test) establishes the claim as accrued when there is a pre-petition relationship between the parties and when the conduct that led to liability occurs pre-petition.  The Jensen test (fair contemplation test) establishes the claim as accrued when the creditor could fairly contemplate the claim's existence.

In this case, the conduct that led to liability was performed pre-petition (the automobile accident 2 years prior to the bankruptcy filing) and it is also at this moment that Cara and Drew had a "relationship" (for purposes of the Piper test).  Therefore, under the Grady test and the Piper Test, Cara's claim would have accrued pre-petition (but her debt is non-dischargeable as she was not listed on the bankruptcy schedules as previously discussed).  Whether Cara could have fairly contemplated the existence of her claim is a question for the courts to decide.  She didn't start experiencing problems until 2019 (post-petition) so the court could find that she couldn't have fairly contemplated the existence of a claim in the bankruptcy until then.  However, she did know of the accident occuring pre-petition and the court may find that she could have fairly contemplated future complications as a result.  I believe that the courts (regarding the Jensen test) are more likely to lean toward her not being able to fairly contemplate the existence of a claim at the date of the petition and declare her claim as nonexistent in the bankruptcy (and giving her free reign to pursue it post bankruptcy).  The overall determination on whether Cara had a claim in the bankruptcy or not depends on the Accrual test the court follows.  If the court follows the Grady or Piper tests, then the court will likely find that she does have a claim in the bankruptcy (but that her claim is not dischargeable since it wasn't listed on the schedules).  If the court follows the Jensen test, then the court will likely (but maybe not) find that she does not have a clam in the bankruptcy at all (and that she is free to pursue her claim post-bankruptcy).

**Trustee Avoiding Powers §544, 547, and 548**

§544: Strong Arm Powers

§547: Preferential Transfers

547(c) Exceptions:

547(c)(1)—contemporaneous exchange exception

547(c)(2)—ordinary course of business exception

547(c)(3)—purchase money security interest exception

547(c)(4)—new value exception

547(c)(5)—“accounts receivable” exemption

Cash is more valuable than uncertain accounts receivable

547(c)(6)—Statutory liens

547(c)(7)—Domestic support obligations

547(c)(8)—De minimis consumer debt

547(c)(9)—De minimis business debt repayment

“substantially contemporaneous” = 10 days

**Unsecured Creditors**

**Preferential Transfers**

Preferring one unsecured creditor over the other §547(b)

Requirements to establish preference

1.  A transfer (defined in section 101(54)),

2.  Of an interest of the debtor in property,

3.  To or for the benefit of a creditor,

4.  For or on account of an antecedent debt,

5.  While the debtor was insolvent (defined in section 101(32)),

6.  Made on or within 90 days of the filing of the petition (one year for “insiders”),

7.  And that allows the creditor to receive more than the creditor would have received (a) had the transfer not been made, and (b) the debtor’s estate liquidated in Chapter 7. (greater amount test)

Nine Exceptions: 547(c)

Note: we never get to section 547(c) unless the transfer meets the definition of a preference in section 547(b).

Group 1: meet definition of preferential transfer, but don’t’ have preferential effect

Group 2: safe harbor

Group 3 Low dollar safe harbours

Group 4: Ordinary course of business 547(c)(2)

**Fraudulent Transfers §548**

A transfer of property is a fraudulent transfer under 548 if it qualifies as either actual fraud or constructive fraud.  Actual fraud is when the debtor transfers property (1) with fraudulent intent towards creditors AND (2) within a 2 year reachback period.  Constructive fraud is when the debtor transfers property AND is insolvent or becomes insolvent from the transfer AND receives less than reasonably equivalent value as consideration for the transfer AND the transfer is within a 2 year reachback period (or 10 year reachback period if all the elements under 548(e)(1) are met).  A transfer (for the special purposes of 548) is defined under 548(d)(1) as when the transfer is perfected so that a bona fide purchaser cannot acquire an interest in it from the debtor.

This did not occur until January 2017 (despite the attorney's complaint about the bureaucracy and initiating the transfer in June of 2016--Drew still could have backed out and sold the property to someone else before January 2017).  This puts the property within the 2 year reachback period for both actual and constructive fraud under 548.  Constructive fraud is unlikely to prevail here as nothing in the facts indicate that Drew was insolvent in JAN 2017 or became insolvent as a result of this property transfer.

Therefore, in order to establish this as a fraudulent transfer under actual fraud, the trustee will have to show that this property occurred with fraudulent intent towards the creditors.  This will be difficult to prove here (as it always is) unless the trustee can use the $10,000 purchase price of the $1 million property in convincing fashion to show actual fraudulent intent.  Drew's transfer of his Bahamas property is therefore unlikely to be established as a fraudulent transfer.

**Actual fraud**

debtor transfers property with fraudulent intent towards creditors (no elements for this in bankruptcy code) (also use 2 year reachback period) Elements:

(1) Fraudulent intent

(2) Within 2 year reachback period

_Constructive fraud_ 548(d)(1)

occurs when debtor transfers property during reachback period (typically 2 years under 548) (regardless of actual fraud) and

(1) debtor meets one of defintions of insolvency (or that the transfer made the debtor insolvent) AND

(2) debtor receives “less than reasonably equivalent value” as consideration for transfer AND

(3) must be within the 2-year reachback period

**Property of the Estate**

Only legal **or** equitable interests at the day of the petition date are part of the estate §541(a)(1)

Setoff §553(a)

Preserves a creditor’s right outside of bankruptcy to set off mutual prepetition debts.

Is Drew's tax refund received on March 3rd, 2019 (for the 2018 tax year) property of the estate?

Property of the estate under 541 includes all legal interests and equitable interests of the Debtor as of the petition date.  This includes proceeds from property of the estate except when the debtor must do post-petition work to earn these proceeds.  Since the petition date in Drew's case falls on September 30, 2018, any returnable taxes as a result from work performed later than that date is not property of the estate as Drew would not have had a legal interest or equitable interest in it as of the petition date.  Drew's attorney represented that Drew's tax return was a result of significant overtime put in in NOV and DEC 2018 which resulted in excess payments of taxes.  This representation is also supported by the evidence that in the 3 years prior to 2018, Drew had not worked overtime and had never received a tax refund (based on normal tax withholdings).

Since this overtimework that generated Drew's tax refund occurred post-petition, it is not property of the estate since Drew had no legal interest or equitable interest in it at the time of his petition.

**Chp 7 (Liquidation)**

Chapter 7 bankruptcy is allows a debtor to file a petition with the court to request discharging your debts. Your debts may be discharged in exchange for you giving up property that’s not exempt. Exempt property covers ____. Chapter 7 does not eliminate mortgage or car loan creditors from taking your property to cover your debts. In order to file under Chapter 7, a debtor has to pass the **means test 707(b)(1)**. If failed, the permitted deductions (707(b)(2)(a)) are reduce from debtor income to determine net monthly amount §707(b)(2)(a). The first way to pass the means test is if your current monthly income is twelve times equal to or less than the state median for the same size household. If yes, the means test automatically passes. The second way to pass the means test is if

Exceptions

Can get around means test if military service or special medical circumstances §707(B)(2)(B)(i)

date of filing is the date that determines what chapter filer is eligible for (filer can opt to change chapter in changed circumstances but can’t be kicked out of a chapter due to a change in circumstances/intent)

Court can still find abuse not under means test, “totality of circumstances”

**Priority Claims §507**

(unsecured claims fitting in the list of 507)

Order of Priority in 507:  (anything over a cap becomes a general unsecured claim)

(1) **Domestic Support Obligations** (regardless of who they are owed to)

(2) **administrative expense claims** (as defined in 503)

Costs of running the bankruptcy estate (typically includes the trustee’s attorney)

Does not include debtor’s bankruptcy attorney (typically charge up front—qualifies for contemporaneous exchange)

Anything done for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate—most litigated issue of this section

(3) **gap claims** (as defined by 502(f))—expenses incurred in-between commencement and order for relief (only in event of involuntary bankruptcy)

(4) **wages and similar employee claims** (capped at $12,850.00 per employee earned 6 months pre-petition)

(5) r**etirement benefits owed to employees**

This is calculated by multiplying $12,850 by the number of employees and subtracting all section (4) priority claims (keeping in mind the cap) and then dividing amount by all employees (pro-rata)

(6) **Farmers and Fishermen** up to $6325 per individual

(7) **deposits up to $2850** (only if you haven’t got what you promised yet—walking into apartment no longer gives priority claim on rent deposit) (deposit owed to another)

(8) **taxes**

For all taxes due in the 3-year span pre-petition (example, if filing on Apr 14th, 2020, then taxes due on Apr 15 2019 [2018 taxes], Apr 15 2018 [2017 taxes], and Apr 15 2017 [2016 taxes] are included)

Extensions are included/factored into 3-year span

(9) **money owed to FDIC**

(10) **death or PI due to DUI**

**Priority 1.5** (bumped up to inbetween 1 and 2)

507(b)—deals with deficiencies resulting from replacement liens provided by the trustee

**Secured Claims §506**

Bifurcation of claims, secured (equal to value of collateral) and unsecured (equal to remaining value of debt)

Oversecured Creditors §506(b) – can increase amount of claim to account for post-petition interest and any contractually permitted costs and fees

**Executory Contracts** (Section 365) – Trustee can:

&lt;![if !supportLists]&gt;(1) &lt;![endif]&gt;assume the obligations of the K or (2) reject the K (effective breach)

**Countryman** (Hypothtical, majority view) v. Perlman (Actual, minority view)

Professor Countryman

“K under which the obligation of both the bankrupt party and other party to the K are so far unperformed that the failure of either to complete performance would constitute a material breach excusing the performance of the other”

Basically when each party has significant unperformed obligations

Court decides on a case-by-case basis whether a K is executory

Perlman

—"a debtor in possession may not assume an executory contract over the nondebtor's objection if applicable law would bar assignment to a hypothetical third party”

•  “actual test” argument where “the statute bars assumption by the debtor in possession only where the reorganization in question results in the nondebtor actually having to accept performance from a third party”

Executory Contracts Checklist

•  Is the contract executory?

&lt;![if !supportLists]&gt;· &lt;![endif]&gt;If not, § 365 does not apply

•  Does the estate want to reject?

o  If yes, apply business judgment test and contract reject. § 365(a)

o  Consequences of rejection:

Rejection treated as breach.

All damages treated as pre-petition unsecured damages. § 365(g)(1)

•  Does the estate wish to assume?

o  Can contract be assigned under § 365(c)?

If no, then no assumption

o  If contract can assigned, was the debtor current and not in default on the filing date?

If yes, then apply business judgment rule and contract assumed. § 365(a)

o  If contract can be assigned, was the debtor in default on the filing date?

If yes, debtor may still assume (§ 365(b)), but only if:

Debtor cures default

Debtor compensates for default

Debtor provides adequate assurance of future performance

o  Consequences of assumption

Contract in full force

Any breach is treated as administrative expense. § 365(g)(2)

•  Does the estate wish to assign the contract?

&lt;![if !supportLists]&gt;· &lt;![endif]&gt;If yes, then must assume and provide adequate assurance that assignee will perform in future. § 365(f)

When ejection in the code is that it creates a breach as of the moment immediately before filing of the petition

**Ipso Facto Clause**

Was the increase of the interest rate on Big Bank's mortgage loan to Drew proper?

This clause in Drew's loan to Big Bank is an Ipso Facto clause which allow creditors (in the contract) to declare default when a debtor enters bankruptcy or becomes insolvent.

The general rule (as derived from the 4th Circuit's holding in In Re Jones) is that Ipso Facto clauses are unenforceable.  There is a **narrow exception** to this general rule, however, created by BAPCPA in 2005 by the addition of 521(d) allowing the enforcement of Ipso Facto clauses if the debtor fails to comply with **521a6 and 362h**.  Unfortunately for Big Bank in this scenario, Drew did **properly file a statement of intention** under 521(a) by entering into a reaffirmation agreement for his property secured by Big Bank's mortgage and completed all the necessary steps to obtain court approval of the agreement.  Accordingly, Big Bank's Ipso Facto clause does not meet the narrow exception to the general rule that Ipso Facto clauses are unenforceable and its increase of the interest rate on the mortgage was improper.

**Chp 13**

Chapter 13 bankruptcy under § allows for debt adjustment, requiring debtors to file a plan to pay back part or all of debts from their current income. Chapter 13 debtors will likely pay more over the long run. Chapter 13 generally allows a debtor to discharge more than what’s allowed under Chapter 7, as a means to incentivize debtors to file under 13.

Chp 13 expands on upon 541’s definition of property of the estate

o  Also includes all property debtor acquires from earnings from services performed by debtor between commencement and termination of chapter 13 case.  (11 USC 1306) - CRITICAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CHAPTER 7 AND CHAPTER 13

Repayment Plan

The repayment plan is filed by the debtor; no other party in interest may file a repayment plan, 11 U.S.C. § 1321. Only the debtor can file a plan and has to file “timely”, 15 days or so. §1321. A debtor can file Chp 13 under section 1321 if: (1) she’s an individual, and (2) has regular income (§101(30)), and (3) has fixed unsecured debts of less than $394,725 and fixed secured debts of less than $1,184,200, §109(e). The court can dismiss the case to a chp 7 if not filed “timely” §1307(c)(3).

•  Attorney’s representing Chapter 13 debtors can charge up to $4,500 that are presumptively reasonable attorney’s fees (up to $4500 is presumed reasonable)

o  This is a FL rule

•  Requirement for confirmation of plan—1325(a)

•  In a chapter 13, only the debtor may file a plan (1321—then entirety of this section)

•  Length—3-5 years (usually 3 years) (1325(b)(4))

o  MUST be 5 years (at least 5 years—1322 limits to 5 years making it 5 years exactly) if fails the means test

•  Classification of claims—simple grouping of claims into categories where everyone in the group will be treated the same (and get the same ratio of payout)

o  All members within the same class MUST be treated the same (1322(a)(3))

o  Only a requirement that the debtor MAY classify claims (not required) (1322(b))

o  NOTE**debtor can choose to discriminate with payout spread (just not within the same class)

  but cannot be in bad faith (basically must be a reasonable reason)

•  Money put into plan—projected disposable income for applicable commitment period (1325(b)(1)(b))

o  Definition of disposable income—1325(b)(2)

o  Money paid from debtor to trustee and trustee makes payments under plan

  (plan is essentially just a schedule of payments for trustee to distribute)

•  Secured Claims

o  Plan confirmed in one of the 3 scenarios involving secured creditors (a, b, and c of 1325(a)(5))

o  Must first be bifurcated into secured portion and unsecured portion (if undersecured) before application of 1325(a)(5)—only affects secured portion

  Unless it is a mortgage on the principled residence of the debtor—then it CANNOT be bifurcated (1322(b)(2))

o  Secured creditors also get interest

•  Priority Claims

o  Guaranteed to be paid in full (unless agreed otherwise) by 1322(a)(2)

o  But NO INTEREST (“deferred cash payments” tell us this)

•  Unsecured Claims—creditors here must go to 1325(b)(1)(b) to complain about the amounts they will receive in the plan (if they don’t believe all of the debtor’s disposable income is in the plan)

o  Also guaranteed to receive at least as much as they would receive in a chapter 7 (although creditors rarely go here since most Chapter 7s are “no asset” chapter 7s

•  ALL payments are made concurrently (1322(b)(4))

**Chapter 11 (Reorg)**

•  Debtor has exclusive period of 120 days after the date of the order of relief to file the plan (1121(b))

o  Plan must be accepted within 180 days of the order of relief or pretty much everyone can jump in and give their own plans (competing plans) (1121(c))

•  small businesses have different rules (shorter periods of time—court may also alter these times)

•  Organization:

o  Typically divides creditors into classes (1123(a)(1))

  Claims classed together must be substantially similar (1122(a))

•  DIFFERENCE from chapter 13—creditors get to vote on the plan in a chapter 11 (1125(b))

o  Disclosure statement is sent out to creditors (when they are voting) and must be approved by the court

o  It is permitted to have different class of creditors receive different disclosure statements (1125(c))

o  Any class of shareholders paid in full AUTOMATICALLY accepts the plan (1126(f)) and shareholders getting paid nothing AUTOMATICALLY reject the plan

  only “impaired” creditors—creditors that aren’t getting paid in full but are still at least getting paid something—get to vote (with a choice)

o  Voting is done by class (not individual votes)—allows debtor to arrange classes strategically

o  Court then determines which of the accepted plans becomes the actual plan

  Must either be a plan that has been accepted by every class and meets the requirements of 1129(a) or one that has been accepted by not everyone that meets the requirements of 1129(a)+(b)

Deductions §707(b)(2)(a)

Final Facts

**Debt relief agency** can’t advise debtor to incur debt in contemplation of bankruptcy.

**Involuntary bankruptcy** is possible because there are only 4 creditors and the value of their claims are such that one creditor who

Cases

Rudler - debtors are permitted a mortgage expense despite the Statement of Intention to surrender the debt

Lynch – allows taking the **larger** of the **actual mortgage expense** and the permitted expense, but only one

Schwabb - The trustee’s 30-day **objection period** kicks in if there is a red flag that the debtor improperly listed the value or the exemption amount (or if it is incomplete), 30 day window **not absolute.**

**Stern -** which says why the bankruptcy court cannot render a **final judgment** (**automatic stay** is traditional state law action, thus relief automatically granted), **but not** why the bankruptcy court should not hear the case at all.

Seare – Can unbundle cases (separate into parts and only work those parts) but has to be reasonable and understood by the clients. It’s unreasonable to unbundle if doing so would violate the core of what the debtors are seeking in bankruptcy.

**Means Testing Calculations**

CMI (average of full six months) * 12 – (permitted deductions),=&lt; state median == pass

‘CMI = monthly payment * months paid, / 6 * 12 = Annual Salary

Ex. 5,000 for four months = 20,000 / 6 *12 = 40,000

IF annual salary &lt; state median, stop here, otherwise, go to permitted deductions
